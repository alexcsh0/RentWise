# RentWise

**RentWise** is a machine learning–based tool that helps users evaluate whether a rental listing is fairly priced. By analyzing key features such as location, size, and amenities, the system predicts a fair market value and classifies listings as underpriced, fair, or overpriced. This tool is designed to assist renters in making informed housing decisions using AI.
